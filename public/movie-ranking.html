<h1>The Best Movies According to Anne</h1>

<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Emperor's New Groove</h3>
<p>
  This is my absolute favorite movie, hands down. The casting is brilliant, the
  humor is reminiscent of Monty Python while still having a lot of heart, and
  there are just so many quotable lines.
</p>

<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
<p>
  A great movie that lands somewhere between a murder mystery and a heist movie.
  The plot twist at the end is executed brilliantly.
</p>

<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>
  If you need me to elaborate on why this is so good, you clearly haven't seen
  the movie (and should probably fix that). The writing is superb, and the cast
  is hilarious. Tim Curry and Madeline Khan are particular standouts, and I
  still quote the "Flames... Flames, on the side of my face..." line to this
  day.
